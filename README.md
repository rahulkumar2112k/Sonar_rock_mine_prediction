# Sonar Rock and Mine Prediction

This project predicts whether a given sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. The model is based on a dataset that contains sonar signals, with each signal labeled as either "M" for mine or "R" for rock.

## Workflow

1. **Sonar Data**: The project begins with a dataset containing sonar signals. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a sonar signal with multiple features, and each label is either "M" (Mine) or "R" (Rock).

2. **Data Processing**: The data is processed and pre-processed to ensure it's ready for training. This step may include normalization, handling missing values, etc.

3. **Train/Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets. This ensures that the model can be trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on another to avoid overfitting.

4. **Logistic Regression Model**: A logistic regression model is used for the prediction task. This model learns to differentiate between "M" and "R" based on the sonar signal features.

5. **Prediction**: After training, the model can predict whether a new sonar signal corresponds to a mine ("M") or a rock ("R").

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Sonar Dataset**, available at the following link:

## Steps to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `Sonar_rock_and_mine_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`).

4. Load the sonar dataset and run the data processing code.

5. Split the data into training and testing sets.

6. Train the logistic regression model and evaluate its performance.

7. Use the trained model to predict whether new data corresponds to a mine or a rock.
